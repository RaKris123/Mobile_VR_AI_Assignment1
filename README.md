**CS-662: Mobile Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence **

Solution of Assignment 1.
Question 1: Please do the following in Unity 3D:

  a. Add a transparent sheet above a plane next to a cube and ensure it does not interfere
    with the physics of the cubes. The transparent sheet should be semi-transparent (alpha
    < 0.5).
  b. Place a directional light in the scene such that it casts shadows of the cubes on the plane.
  c. Ensure that the particle system effects you create in the scene also cast shadows on the
    plane.
  d. Provide a brief explanation of how you set up the transparency, lighting, and shadow
    casting for the cubes and particle system in Unity.

Question 2: Please do the following in Unity 3D:

  a. Take a cube and a plane and put the cube on the plane.
  b. Please give an appropriate color to the cube (yellow) and the plane (green).
  c. Now, please convert the cube into 5 cubes on the plane, where each cube is placed at a
    random location in the plane.
  d. Now, raise these cubes to a height above the plane and apply physics such that all 5
    cubes fall on the plane upon running the game. 

Question 3: Please do the following in Unity 3D:

  a. Take a cube and a plane and put the cube on the plane. Please give an appropriate color
    to the cube (yellow) and the plane (green).
  b. Now, make the cube move on the plane such that by pressing the left or right key, the
    cube rotates anti-clockwise or clockwise respectively. Furthermore, upon clicking the
    forward key the cube moves forward in the facing direction.
  c. Now, enable the cube to jump once upon space bar press so that the user can also make
    it jump by pressing the space bar. 

Question 4: Please explain the history of VR technology from 1935 onwards till now briefly
